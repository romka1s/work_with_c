Certainly! Let's first understand the issues in your current code and then provide an updated version that correctly solves the problem.

Issues with the Original Code:
Binary Search Tree Not Used:

The problem requires using a binary search tree (BST) to store words when removing duplicates, but the original code uses an array (words[MAX_WORDS]) and linear search (strcmp) to check for duplicates.
Punctuation Marks Not Removed Correctly:

The code does not properly remove punctuation marks from the output. According to the problem statement, punctuation marks should not appear in the output for lines within the specified range.
Incorrect Command-Line Argument Parsing:

The code does not correctly parse command-line arguments, especially when handling the -d (or --diapason) option.
Options -w and -l can be combined with -d, but the code doesn't handle this properly.
Options -w and -l Mutual Exclusivity Not Enforced:

The code needs to ensure that options -w and -l are not used together.
Processing Lines Outside the Specified Range:

Lines outside the specified range should be output exactly as they are in the input file, but the code may not handle this correctly.
Memory Leaks:

The code uses strdup without freeing the allocated memory, which can lead to memory leaks.
Solution:
To address these issues, we'll make the following changes:

Implement a Binary Search Tree:

We'll define a TreeNode structure and implement insert and search functions for the BST.
The BST will store words and help in checking for duplicates efficiently.
Properly Remove Punctuation Marks:

We'll modify the word extraction logic to exclude punctuation marks both when storing words in the BST and when outputting them.
Correct Command-Line Argument Parsing:

We'll rewrite the argument parsing to handle options in any order and support the combination of -d with either -w or -l.
We'll enforce mutual exclusivity between -w and -l.
Process Lines According to Range and Options:

Lines outside the specified range will be output unchanged.
Lines within the range will be processed according to the selected option (-w or -l).
Handle Memory Management:

We'll ensure that all dynamically allocated memory is properly freed to avoid memory leaks.



Explanation of the Solution:
1. Binary Search Tree Implementation:
TreeNode Structure:
    typedef struct TreeNode {
        char *word;
        struct TreeNode *left, *right;
    } TreeNode;
We define a TreeNode structure to represent nodes in the BST.
Each node stores a word and pointers to its left and right children.


Insert Function:
    int insert(TreeNode **root, const char *word) {
        // Implementation...
    }
The insert function adds a word to the BST.
If the word already exists, it returns 1 (indicating a duplicate); otherwise, it returns 0.
This function recursively traverses the tree to find the correct position for the new word.

Free Tree Function:
    void free_tree(TreeNode *root) {
        // Implementation...
    }
This function frees all nodes in the BST to prevent memory leaks.
2. Processing Lines with Duplicate Words:
remove_duplicate_words Function:
    void remove_duplicate_words(char *line, const char *word_to_remove) {
        // Implementation...
    }
This function processes a single line, removing duplicate words and punctuation.
It uses the BST to check for duplicates efficiently.
Punctuation marks are skipped during word extraction.
Word Extraction and Punctuation Removal:

We iterate over each character in the line.
We skip any separators (punctuation marks and spaces).
We build words character by character until we hit a separator.
Punctuation marks are not included in the words stored in the BST or output.
Handling word_to_remove:

We keep track of the first occurrence of word_to_remove using the first_occurrence flag.
The first occurrence is processed normally.
Subsequent occurrences of word_to_remove are skipped and not output.
Output Formatting:

Words are output in the order they appear in the line.
Words are separated by a single space.
No leading or trailing spaces are added to the line.
3. Processing Lines with Duplicate Lines:

remove_duplicate_lines Function:

    void remove_duplicate_lines(FILE *input, int start_line, int end_line) {
        // Implementation...
    }

This function reads the input file line by line.
It keeps track of the previous line to identify consecutive duplicate lines.
Only the first occurrence of consecutive duplicate lines within the specified range is output.
Lines outside the range are output unchanged.
4. Command-Line Argument Parsing:

Mutual Exclusivity of Options -w and -l:

    if (option_w && option_l) {
        fprintf(stderr, INCORRECT_PARAMS);
        return 1;
    }

The code checks that both options are not used simultaneously and outputs an error if they are.
Handling the -d Option:

The -d option can be combined with either -w or -l.
The start and end lines are parsed, and defaults are set if not provided.
The code ensures that the start line is less than or equal to the end line if both are provided.
Parsing Options in Any Order:

The code loops through the arguments and handles options regardless of their order.
Unrecognized options result in an error message.

5. Processing the File According to Options:
Option -w:
The process_file function is called, which processes each line, removes duplicates, and outputs the result.

Option -l:
The remove_duplicate_lines function is called, which handles duplicate lines.

6. Handling Edge Cases and Errors:

Error Messages:
The code outputs specific error messages to stderr for different types of errors, as specified in the problem statement.
Memory Management:

All dynamically allocated memory (e.g., words in the BST) is freed after use to prevent memory leaks.
